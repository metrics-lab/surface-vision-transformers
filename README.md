# Surface Vision Transformers

This repository contains codebase to apply vision transformers on surface data. This is the official PyTorch implementation of [Surface Vision Transformers: Attention-Based Modelling applied to Cortical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16414), presented at the MIDL 2022 conference.  


Here, Surface Vision Transformer (**SiT**) is applied on cortical data for phenotype predictions.

# Installation & Set-up

## 1. Connectome Workbench

Connectome Workbench is a free software for visualising neuroimaging data and can be used for visualising cortical metrics on surfaces. Downloads and instructions [here](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench). 

## 2. Conda usage

For PyTorch and dependencies installation with conda, please follow instructions in [install.md](docs/install.md).

## 3. Docker usage

**Coming soon**

For docker support, please follow instructions in [docker.md](docs/docker.md)

# Data 

Data used in this project comes from the [dHCP dataset](http://www.developingconnectome.org/). Instructions for processing MRI scans and extract cortical metrics can be found in [S. Dahan et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16414) and references cited in.

To simplify reproducibility of the work, data has been already processed and is made available by following the next guidelines. 



## 1. Accessing processed data

Cortical surface metrics already processed as in [S. Dahan et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16414) and [A. Fawaz et al 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.01.470730v1) are available upon request.

  <summary><b> G-Node GIN repository</b></summary>
      <p>
      Once the confirmation has been sent, you will have access to the <b>G-Node GIN repository</b> containing the data already processed.
      The data used for this project is in the zip files <i>`regression_native_space_features.zip`</i> and <i>`regression_template_space_features.zip`</i>. You also need to use the <i>`ico-6.surf.gii`</i> spherical mesh.

**Training** and **validation** sets are available for the task of **birth-age** and **scan-age** prediction, in **template** and **native** configuration.

However the test set is not currently publicly available as used as testing set in the [SLCN challenge](https://slcn.grand-challenge.org/) on surface learning alongside the MLCN workshop at MICCAI 2022. 

## 2. Data preparation for training

Once the data is accessible, further preparation steps are required to get right and left metrics files in the same orientation, before extracting the sequences of patches.

1. Download zip files containing the cortical features: `regression_template_space_features.zip` and `regression_native_space_features.zip`. Unzip the files. Data is in the format
```
{uid}_{hemi}.shape.gii 
```

2. Download the `ico-6.surf.gii` spherical mesh from the G-Node GIN repository. This icosphere is *by default* set to a CORTEX_RIGHT structure in workbench. 

3. Rename the `ico-6.surf.gii` file as `ico-6.R.surf.gii`

4. Create a new sphere by symmetrising the righ sphere using workbench. In bash:

```
wb_command -surface-flip-lr ico-6.R.surf.gii ico-6.L.surf.gii
```
5. Then, set the structure of the new icosphere to `CORTEX_LEFT`. In bash:
```
wb_command -set-structure ico-6.L.surf.gii CORTEX_LEFT
```

6. Use the new left sphere to resample all left metric files in the template and native data folder. In bash: 
```
cd regression_template_space_features

for i in *L*; do wb_command -metric-resample ${i} ../ico-6.R.surf.gii ../ico-6.L.surf.gii BARYCENTRIC ${i}; done
```
and 
```
cd regression_native_space_features

for i in *L*; do wb_command -metric-resample ${i} ../ico-6.R.surf.gii ../ico-6.L.surf.gii BARYCENTRIC ${i}; done
```

7. Set the structure of the right metric files to CORTEX_LEFT, in both template and native data folder. In bash: 
```
cd regression_template_space_features

for i in *R*; do wb_command -set-structure ${i} CORTEX_LEFT; done
```
and
```
cd regression_native_space_features

for i in *R*; do wb_command -set-structure ${i} CORTEX_LEFT; done
```

      <p>
      Once symmetrised, both left and right hemispheres have the same orientation when visualised on a left hemipshere template.

7. Once this step is done, the preprocessing script can be used to prepare the training and validation numpy array files, per task (birth-age, scan-age) and data configuration (template, native). 

In the YAML file `config/preprocessing/hparams.yml`, change the path to data, set the parameters and run the `preprocessing.py` script in ./tools:

```
cd tools
python preprocessing.py ../config/preprocessing/hparams.yml
```

# Training & Inference

## Training SiT

For training a SiT model, use the following command:

```
python train.py ../config/SiT/training/hparams.yml
```
Where all hyperparameters for training and model design models are to be set in the yaml file `config/preprocessing/hparams.yml`, such as: 

- Transformer architecture
- Training strategy: from scratch, ImageNet or SSL weights
- Optimisation strategy
- Patching configuration
- Logging

## Testing SiT

For testing a SiT model, please put the path of the SiT weights in /testing/hparams.yml and use the following command: 

```
python test.py ../config/SiT/training/hparams.yml
```
